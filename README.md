# ARSino
A small, and cute, Audience Response System powered by web2py and python3

## DISCLAIMER. 
A bigger disclaimer than usual: I am NOT a coder, I can just write some code. The code will not be elegant and may still be buggy. However, it's been used in real life scenarios, with about one hundred university students per session, and it has worked well.

## Database

ARSino exploits the power of database handling offered by web2py. There are several tables defined in the database, some are standard for a web2py installation and include users, permissions, groups, etc. The tables specific for ARSino are 4:
- *domanda*: this contains all the questions ever created, including the set of answers presented and the correct answer. It is possible to add one image to each question, the link to which will be stored in this table.
- *sessione*: this table contains the presentation sessions. The fields are a unique human-friendly code (e.g. using the date as MMDD), the actual date of the session and a brief description.
- *OdG*: this is the agenda for the day and relates the two prevous tables, therefore storing which questions will be available in each presentation session
- *risposte*: this is the biggest table as it will store all the answers from the audience. Its fields are the session code (the human-friendly one defined in the table *sessione*), the text of the question (arguably, this should be replaced with the question id, from the table *domanda*), the identifier of the respondent and the answer given (just an integer). The identifier is randomly generated by web2py, although it contains the IP address of the client: the objective is not to identify the respondent but only telling them apart, e.g. to provide feedback and prevent double answers.
